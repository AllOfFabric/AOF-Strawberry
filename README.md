# AOF-Strawberry

An almost Vanilla Minecraft Fabric ModPack (1.14.4)

[Mods List](https://github.com/AllOfFabric/AOF-Strawberry/wiki/AOF-Strawberry-2.4.0)

Compatible with [Optifabric and Optifine](https://github.com/modmuss50/OptiFabric)

Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/AllOfFabric/AOF-Strawberry/releases/latest)

The server zip file is a ready to install server instance:

- Run `_install.cmd` to download and generate the server files
- Run `_install_mods.cmd` to download the mod jars to the server mods folder

The client zip file is a MultiMC instance, just add a new instance, "Import from zip", paste the zip URL

Notes:

If you enable disabled mods in your client, and the mod is listed as (Client+Server), then the mod has to also be enabled in the server. Official AOF servers will have the mods disabled by default.

Mods listed as (Client) can be safely enabled only on the client.

Optifine is not included in the modpack because Optifine does not want to be included in modpacks.
